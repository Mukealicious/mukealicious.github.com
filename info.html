      <p class="emphasize">
        I am a purpose driven designer with a passion for products. A <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign/">realigner not a redesigner</a>. I don't like making things pretty, I like making them better.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've always thought of myself to have a somewhat conflicted personality. Right brain vs left brain. Artist vs accountant. An artist in the sense that I love ideas and doing things in a new way. I work best on the outer edges; not the status quo. Ideas really inspire and motivate me to do good work. On the other side, an accountant type in the sense that everything has to have a place. There must be purpose behind every product and design decision. You could say, in terms of design, the books have to balance.

        I studied web design, as well as every other form of design I could sink my teeth into, back in high school. I took the classes, but the majority of my learning was on my own projects even before then. In the beginning it was all about skate videos. The web was the platform to share what we had created. It never felt like learning, and money was the farthest thing from my mind. The idea that technology enabled me to create and share my work on the same level as any seasoned professional was completely intoxicating to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my professional career as a designer 5 years ago in the apparel industry while attending Vanguard University as a Business Administration major. Working as an apparel designer taught me <em>so much</em> about design and how a business works outside of the classroom. Beyond that, I realized how broken the traditional retail model truly is. Around a year ago I wrote <a href="http://kontorsioninc.com/2011/07/its-still-got-that-new-blog-smell/">this article</a> touching on the subject. This was shortly before I decided to take a step back and fully focus on the web. I felt my learning had plateaued, and it was time for me to move on.
      </p>

      <p>
        My recent focus on the web has brought back that intoxicating feeling of endless possibilites. The same feeling as when I was first learning design and how to use all of the exciting new tools technology provides us. The idea that a whole industry can be disrupted with the right team and an understanding of the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, here we are. An unfinished story. I'm unsure of what the future holds, but I intend to openly share my experiences and everythign learned along the way.
