      <p>I am a purpose driven designer. A <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign/">realigner not a redesigner.</a> I don't like making things pretty, I like making things better.</p>

      <p>I've always thought of myself to have a conflicted personality. Right brain vs left brain. Artist vs accountant. I'm an artist in the sense that I love ideas and doing things in a new way. I work best on the outer edges, not the status quo. Ideas really inspire and motivate me to do good work. On the other hand, I'm an accountant type in the sense that everything has to have a place. There has to be purpose behind every product and design decision. You could say, in terms of design, "The books have to balance".</p>

      <p>I learned web design, as well as almost every other form of design I could sink my teeth into, back in high school. It never fully hooked me because of the lack of control that was possible at that time, especially visually. So, for that reason, I gravitated toward print.</p>

      <p>I started my professional career as a designer about 5 years ago in the apparel industry. Working as an apparel designer taught me <em>so much</em> about design, and I also learned that I can't stand the traditional retail model. Around a year ago I wrote <a href="http://kontorsioninc.com/2011/07/its-still-got-that-new-blog-smell/">this article</a> touching on the subject. This was shortly before I decided to take a step back and fully focus on the web.</p>

      <p>I love that a small group of peers that work in a very non-digital industry, but have an understanding of digital, can team up and turn that industry on it's head. That's the power of the web, not just what we're seeing in the "tech" and surrounding industries.</p>
