      <p class="emphasize">
        I'm a designer entrepreneur. A worn-out clich&#233;, but I'll do my best to explain. I am, above all, driven to create new things. I love to solve problems in simple elegant ways. Design is only one facet of the process. A tool used in bringing new ideas into existence. It just so happens to be my tool of choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started my professional career as a <mark>designer in the apparel industry</mark>. I was an intern, apparel designer, and eventually partner at a small design &amp; production shop in Southern California, <a href="http://kontorsioninc.com">Kontorsion</a>. Our team was small, but we learned to hustle. We worked with almost every big box retailer out there, and sometimes that meant <mark>learning things the hard way</mark>. It was an invaluable experience for me as a young designer, and even more so as an entrepreneur. I eventually moved on, somewhat jaded by wholesale and the politics that come with it. I wanted to create things, solve problems, but as time passed we were doing less and less of what made us start in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until recently, I was the <mark>lead front-end developer</mark> at <a href="http://stylehatch.co/">Style Hatch</a>. We were able to work alongside Tumblr building premium themes for the Tumblr Theme Garden. Experiencing their growth first hand was pretty incredible. We even got the opportunity to <mark>work with Yahoo</mark> to develop a <a href="http://yahoo.tumblr.com/">custom theme</a> for all of their blogs to kick off the Yahoo Tumblr acquisition.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm now working as a <mark>full-time freelancer</mark>. Enjoying time focused on side projects and working with startups in the healthcare space.
