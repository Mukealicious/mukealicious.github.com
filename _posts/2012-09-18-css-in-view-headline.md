I was recently working on a project for a company I co-founded, [Therascript](http://therascript.com). We just applied for [Rock Health](http://rockhealth.com/), a healthcare specific startup incubator in San Francisco. For the application we decided to build a presentation deck type page instead of just filling out the standard application form or building a powerpoint. While doing this I came up with a nice little CSS only headline trick that I thought I would share. It mimics a JavaScript "in view" type of event with no JS required. It isn't a perfect solution, but it worked great for this specific situation.

I can't show the acutal application page so I made an [extra special demo page](/css-inview-demo.html) just for you.
